# Disease-Symptom-Analysis

#Project Description

Collaborated in a team project to analyze the relationship between symptoms and diseases using the Disease-symptom.csv dataset, writing code for data processing, selecting a random sample of 1,000 records out of 4,920, and analyzing results to support medical diagnosis.

Understanding these relationships is valuable for assisting healthcare professionals and researchers in diagnosing diseases based on presented symptoms.

Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps included:

•Loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame
•Handling missing values
•Removing duplicates
•Normalizing numerical data
•Tokenizing symptom text fields
•Validating symptom-disease relationships

These steps ensured a clean, accurate, and reliable dataset ready for analysis and visualization.

Analysis

For statistical analysis, we used the statistics library to compute:

•Mean
•Median
•Mode
We also used Pandas to:
•Calculate the correlation matrix
•Perform word frequency analysis using Series.value_counts()
•Group and aggregate data using groupby()

⸻

Visualizations

To explore and present the data visually, we used:

•Matplotlib
•Seaborn

We applied various types of visualizations to show the relationships between symptoms and diseases. The selection of each chart type was based on data suitability, allowing for the most effective and meaningful representation of insights.
