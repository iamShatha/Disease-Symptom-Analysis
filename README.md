# Disease-Symptom-Analysis
 
The data file defines the relationship between different symptoms and possible diseases
The dataset includes several files. We will use the Disease-symptom.csv file. 


#Description of the Dataset 

The dataset includes several files. We will use the Disease-symptom.csv file. 
The file is general disease-related data and contains 4920 lines but we will 
use a sample of it containing 1000 lines randomly. The data file defines the 
relationship between different symptoms and possible diseases. This 
association is useful in helping healthcare professionals and researchers 
diagnose diseases based on the symptoms presented. 

• Analysis 
we well use mean , median and mode from statistics library  
and use DataFrame from pandas to compute the correlation matrix of 
the dataset 
use Series.value_counts() for word frequency analysis.  
Use groupby() from pandas to group data and apply aggregate 
functions 

• Preprocessing 
In the disease symptom prediction project, I will load the file into a Pandas 
DataFrame. And handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize 
numerical data. Additionally, I will tokenize symptom text and validate the 
dataset to ensure accurate relationships between symptoms and diseases. 
This will result in a clean dataset ready for analysis and visualization. 

• Visualizations 
We will be using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to show the 
relationship between some symptoms and diseases.  
Also, we will be including different types of data presentations. 
The choice of data visualization will depend on the suitability and 
availability of the data,  which allows us to select the most appropriate representation
